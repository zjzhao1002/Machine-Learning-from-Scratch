# Linear Regression

## Introduction

Linear regression is a simple machine learning model. 
It is useful in predicting a continuous variable by one or more indepedent variables.

I built a linear regression model from scratch by **numpy** to understand the key concepts and algorithm.
This model is test by the [Student Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression/) dataset. 
The dataset aims to provide insights into the relationship between the independent variables and the performance index.

I learned linear regression by this article
