# Gradient Boosting Regressor from Scratch

## Motivation 
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification.
As a boosting technique, it gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of a sequence of weak models, 
which are typically simple decision trees.
When a decision tree is the weak learner, the resulting algorithm is called gradient-boosted trees.

I learned the maths and concepts by this [article](https://randomrealizations.com/posts/gradient-boosting-machine-from-scratch/) 
and this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/egazakharenko/gradient-boosting-from-scratch-full-tutorial).
