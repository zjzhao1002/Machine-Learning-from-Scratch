# Gradient Boosting Classifier from Scratch
## Motivation
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification.
As a boosting technique, it gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of a sequence of weak models, 
which are typically simple decision trees.
In this project, I built a gradient boosting classifier from scratch to understand the maths and concepts. 
This model is test by the [Iris Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) dataset. 

I learned the gradient boosting classifier from this 
[article](https://randomrealizations.com/posts/gradient-boosting-multi-class-classification-from-scratch/) and 
this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/egazakharenko/gradient-boosting-from-scratch-full-tutorial/notebook).
