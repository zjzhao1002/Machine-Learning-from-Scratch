# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
I built machine learning models from scratch to understand their algorithms. 
The following models have been built and test:
* [(Fully Connected) Neural Network](https://github.com/zjzhao1002/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/Neural_Network)
* [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/zjzhao1002/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/Convolutional_Neural_Network)
* [Decison Tree](https://github.com/zjzhao1002/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/Decision_Tree)
* [Random Forest](https://github.com/zjzhao1002/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/Random_Forest)
* [Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)](https://github.com/zjzhao1002/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/AdaBoost)
