# Neural Network from Scratch

## Motivation

In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN)
is a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks.

To understand the key concepts and maths of neural network, I built a neural network from scratch by using **numpy** only.
The purpose of this network is to recognize handwritten digits in the [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animatronbot/mnist-digit-recognizer).
I mainly follow this [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
